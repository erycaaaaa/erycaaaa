## ✨ Tech Stack

- 🎨 UI/UX Design: Figma
- 💻 Frontend: HTML, CSS
- 📊 Data Analysis: Python, Google Colab

#### Responsive Card Theme

![Eryca's GitHub stats - Dark](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=erycaaaaa&show_icons=true&theme=dark#gh-dark-mode-only)
![Eryca's GitHub stats - Light](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=erycaaaaa&show_icons=true&theme=default#gh-light-mode-only)

Since GitHub will re-upload the cards and serve them from their [CDN](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/about-anonymized-urls), we can not infer the browser/GitHub theme on the server side. There are, however, four methods you can use to create dynamics themes on the client side.
